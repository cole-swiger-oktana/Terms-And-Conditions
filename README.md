# Terms and Conditions Challenge

This repository contains all of my customizations from my Salesforce org for the community site and flow, as well as documentation for my submission.

I may have grabbed more metadata than necessary when pulling everything from the org an dpushing here, so sorry about that! The bulk of my work was done in the Experience site, and with the User, Product, and Account and Contacts objects.

You can also find the [Terms and Conditions Walkthough](https://github.com/cole-swiger-oktana/Terms-And-Conditions/blob/main/Terms%20and%20Conditions%20Walkthrough.pdf) and [Terms and Conditions Design Document](https://github.com/cole-swiger-oktana/Terms-And-Conditions/blob/main/Terms%20and%20Conditions%20Design%20Document.pdf) in this repository for a more detailed explanation.
